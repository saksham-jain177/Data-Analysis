# Project 2
Project Name: GeeksforGeeks Data Analysis

Description:
The "GeeksforGeeks Data Analysis" project involves scraping and analyzing the video dataset from the GeeksforGeeks YouTube channel.
The project consists of the following main steps:

  1. **Data Gathering**:
        Utilize the YouTube Data API to fetch video details from the GeeksforGeeks YouTube channel.
        Specify the time range of the past 6 months to filter relevant videos.
        Retrieve video titles, views, upload dates, video lengths, and other relevant information.

  2. **Data Processing and Analysis**:
        Calculate the total views and video lengths for each topic.
        Identify the most viewed topics during the specified time period.
        Determine the correlation between the number of views and video lengths.

  3. **Visualization**:
        Create graphical representations using libraries like matplotlib to visualize the relationship between views and video lengths.
        Generate bar plots, scatter plots, or other relevant visualizations to showcase trends and patterns.

  4. **Insights and Findings**:
        Analyze the data to uncover insights such as the most popular topics and their associated video lengths.
        Provide insights into user preferences, engagement patterns, and potential correlations between views and video lengths.

# Project 3
Project Name : Cardekho Used Car Price Analysis

Description
The "Cardekho Used Car Price Analysis" project involves analyzing the used car dataset from Cardekho to uncover insights about the factors influencing the selling price of used cars. The project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: 
   - The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and includes various features such as selling price, vehicle age, KM driven, engine size, max power, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values by dropping rows with any null values.
   - Removed duplicate entries.
   - Standardized text columns (fuel_type, seller_type, transmission_type).
   - Removed outliers from the selling_price column using the IQR method.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed univariate, bivariate, and categorical variable analyses to identify key trends and insights.
   - Analyzed the correlation between numerical variables.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created graphical representations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the relationship between various features and the selling price.
   - Generated distribution plots, scatter plots, count plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to showcase trends and patterns.

5. **Insights and Findings**:
   - Analyzed the data to uncover insights such as the impact of vehicle age, KM driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type on the selling price.
   - Provided insights into market trends and recommendations for buyers and sellers based on the analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Dropped rows with any null values to ensure data integrity.
- **Removing Duplicate Entries**: Removed duplicate records to avoid redundancy.
- **Standardizing Text Columns**: Standardized the text columns for fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.
- **Removing Outliers**: Applied the IQR method to remove outliers from the selling_price column.
