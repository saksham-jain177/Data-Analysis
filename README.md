  3. **Visualization**:
        Create graphical representations using libraries like matplotlib to visualize the relationship between views and video lengths.
        Generate bar plots, scatter plots, or other relevant visualizations to showcase trends and patterns.

  4. **Insights and Findings**:
        Analyze the data to uncover insights such as the most popular topics and their associated video lengths.
        Provide insights into user preferences, engagement patterns, and potential correlations between views and video lengths.

# Project 3
Project Name : Cardekho Used Car Price Analysis

Description
The "Cardekho Used Car Price Analysis" project involves analyzing the used car dataset from Cardekho to uncover insights about the factors influencing the selling price of used cars. The project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: 
   - The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and includes various features such as selling price, vehicle age, KM driven, engine size, max power, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values by dropping rows with any null values.
   - Removed duplicate entries.
   - Standardized text columns (fuel_type, seller_type, transmission_type).
   - Removed outliers from the selling_price column using the IQR method.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed univariate, bivariate, and categorical variable analyses to identify key trends and insights.
   - Analyzed the correlation between numerical variables.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created graphical representations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the relationship between various features and the selling price.
   - Generated distribution plots, scatter plots, count plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to showcase trends and patterns.

5. **Insights and Findings**:
   - Analyzed the data to uncover insights such as the impact of vehicle age, KM driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type on the selling price.
   - Provided insights into market trends and recommendations for buyers and sellers based on the analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Dropped rows with any null values to ensure data integrity.
- **Removing Duplicate Entries**: Removed duplicate records to avoid redundancy.
- **Standardizing Text Columns**: Standardized the text columns for fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.
- **Removing Outliers**: Applied the IQR method to remove outliers from the selling_price column.

# Project 4
Project Name : Sonar Mine Prediction

Description
The "Sonar Mine Prediction" project involves building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either mines (M) or rocks (R). The project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Gathering**:
   - The dataset used is "Day1_Data_Sonar_Data.csv", which contains sonar readings.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Verified the presence of missing values and outliers.
   - Identified and handled numerical and categorical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the summary statistics of numerical and categorical features.
   - Performed value counts for the target variable to understand class distribution.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Created feature matrix (X) and target variable (y).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets using a stratified split.
   - Built and evaluated a logistic regression model.
   - Compared the performance of different classification models.

5. **Model Comparison**:
   - Compared Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Evaluated models based on accuracy scores.

6. **Insights and Findings**:
   - Analyzed the performance of different models and determined the best model based on accuracy.
